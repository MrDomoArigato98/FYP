The main code of the system is in main.py program. 
n order to run this system, it is ideal to use anaconda for scientific python and import any of the 
missing libraries that are seen on top in the python files. 
Stdnum, datetime, pyteserract and psycopg2 may be missing from Scientific Anaconda. 

They can be imported as in the following example in powershell:
/*Pip install python-stdnum*/

*Pip install pytesseract

Authenti-Note is launched once main.py is started. 
Make sure the folders with images are in a directory called Banknotes, 
this is used for reference images for the feature extraction and is essential.
